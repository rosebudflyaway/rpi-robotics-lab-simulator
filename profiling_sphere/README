The test case is on spheres only right now, so please disregard the other meshed object files: Body_Edge.h, Body_Face.h, Body_polymesh.h, Body_trimesh.h, Body_vertex.h and the corresponding cpp files. 

The make file is located at .../profiling_spheres/nbproject
Add the dependent libraries to the Makefile-Debug.mk

The executable after compiling and linking is located at .../profiling_spheres/dist/Debug/GNU-Linux-x86



Before compiling the code, make sure the Armadillo, Lapack/Blas are installed, manually add the PATH to the library in the Makefile-Debug.mk file;

Change the directory in line 44 and line 59 in main.cpp to your local directory

Following are the procedures to compile, link and run the code.
1. To profile the performance of the code, I use gprof as the profiling tool, by adding -pg tag to both compile and link in the makefile, which is done already (DONE)

2. $ make 

3. $ cd ./dist/Debug/GNU-Linux-x86
   $ ./rpi-sim    
   $ ls 
   There will be a file named 'gmon.out'

4. $ gprof rpi-sim gmon.out >> profiling.txt 
   This will convert gmon.out to a readable txt file 'profiling.txt' 


5. -b suppress verbose blurbs using -b: 
   $ gprof -b rpi-sim gmon.out >> profiling_b.txt 

6. -p only get the flat profile 
   $ gprof -b -p rpi-sim gmon.out >> profiling_p.txt
